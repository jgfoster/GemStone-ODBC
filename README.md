# GemStone-ODBC
Proof-of-concept showing a Windows ODBC driver for GemStone. This is a Microsoft Visual Studio Solution.

I narrated this silent [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4eRnVgzXvw) at an ESUG conference. 

These [slides](Slides.pdf) describe the same project, but were used at a different conference so don't match the video exactly.

I thought this was a fun project, and I'd enjoy pursuing it further, but (as described in the slides) it isn't a panacea, other solutions are available (custom exporters), and this has never had sufficient demand to make it a priority.
